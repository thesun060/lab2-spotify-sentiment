Definition of the Problem

This project's objective is to evaluate user reviews of the Spotify mobile app and use rating information to infer the sentiment of each review. Dates, ratings, user comments, and other pertinent data are included in the dataset. The goal is to use the available data to create a machine learning model that can categorize reviews as either positive or negative.

Entering

The user review text and associated information, including rating, likes, and app version, are the system's input.

Results

The output is the anticipated review sentiment, which can be either positive or negative.

Problem Type

Since the objective is to assign each review to a particular category (positive or negative), this is a classification problem.
